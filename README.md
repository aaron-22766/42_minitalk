## ðŸ—£ About

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

## ðŸ›  Usage

### Requirements

The game is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run. 

### Instructions

Execute the binaries on from different shells:
```shell
$> make
$> ./server
Server PID: 4242
```
Give the server pid as the first argument to the client followed by the message to send
```shell
$> ./client 4242 "some_message"
```
